# mongodb-jongo-example
A Mongo DB CRUD application using Jongo Java Driver

<p>Run the application:</p>
<p>Just start your <code>mongod</code> instance and run the JUnit tests to see how it works.</p>
<p>If you haven't set authentication for your database, you need to in order to use my project. You can do that from the mongo shell:</p>
<code>
db.addUser('root', '1234');
</code>
Have fun!
